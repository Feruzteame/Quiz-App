# [QUIZ GAME](https://becodeorg.github.io/verou-3-end-with-a-bang-lets-Play/quiz/dist/index.html)

## HOW IT WORKS ?
- choose type of question
- Put your answer in the input
- click submit
- check your feedback right side of page(red for incorrect answer with correction / green correct answer)
- See total score (one question => 5pts)
- Start over to play again

## What I test
- to install webpack
- [animation css](https://animate.style/#documentation)
- Sound
- [open API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

## difficulties
- The Api is only for true false and choices 
- e.g <b>Which one</b> is the best language for building games?
